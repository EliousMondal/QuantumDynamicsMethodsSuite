# QuantumDynamicsMethodsSuite

The methods housed in the files "QuantumDynamicsSuite.py" and "spin-PLDM" comprise an assortment of mixed quantum classical methods for electronic and nuclear propagation in the diabatic representation. The corresponding model files can be used with any method and should simply be imported in the method-code import block as needed. The model file contains all necessary parameters for running the model dynamics.
